-        Enterprise Edition transit routers allow you to specify elastic network interfaces (ENIs) as multicast members. You can call the `RegisterTransitRouterMulticastGroupMembers` operation to add ENIs in the same region or in different regions to a multicast group as multicast members.
-        *   If you specify a value for **NetworkInterfaceIds**, ENIs in the current region are specified as multicast members. Make sure that the vSwitches of the ENIs are associated with the multicast domain. For more information, see [AssociateTransitRouterMulticastDomain](~~429778~~).
-        *   If you specify a value for **PeerTransitRouterMulticastDomains**, multicast members in the multicast group that has the same IP address as the current multicast group but is in a different region are added to the current multicast group. Make sure that an inter-region connection is created. For more information, see [CreateTransitRouterPeerAttachment](~~261363~~).
-        For example, Alice created a multicast domain (Domain A) in the Australia (Sydney) region and a multicast domain (Domain B) in the UK (London) region. Domain A contains a multicast group (Group A), and Domain B contains a multicast group (Group B). Group A and Group B have the same multicast IP address. Group B in UK (London) contains a multicast member (Member B). When Alice calls the `RegisterTransitRouterMulticastGroupMembers` operation, if she sets **PeerTransitRouterMulticastDomains** to the ID of Member B in Group B that is in the UK (London) region, Member B is added to Group A in the Australia (Sydney) region.
-        *   The `RegisterTransitRouterMulticastGroupMembers` operation is an asynchronous operation. After you send a request, the system returns a **request ID** and runs the task in the background. You can call the `ListTransitRouterMulticastGroups` operation to query the status of a multicast member.
-        *   If a multicast member is in the **Registering** state, the multicast member is being added. You can query the multicast member but cannot perform other operations.
